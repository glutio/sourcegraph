# Migrating from Sourcegraph 2.13 to 3.0.0

3.0 includes a few major product and configuration changes that you should be aware of if you are upgrading an existing instance.

## Zero configuration code intelligence is on by default for 10 languages

The [sourcegraph/basic-code-intel](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/basic-code-intel) extension has been deprecated and split into one extension per language, with the top 10 [programming language extensions](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions?query=category%3A"Programming+languages") enabled by default.

If you have [sourcegraph/basic-code-intel](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/basic-code-intel) enabled, disable it and enable any additional extensions for languages you use.

Check out the [code intelligence documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user/code_intelligence) and the individual language extension READMEs for information about setting up language servers for more precise code intelligence in some languages.

## Repositories are managed by configuring external services

TODO(nick): finish this

External services UI is available at `/site-admin/external-services`.

## `repos.list` was removed from site configuration

The top-level `repos.list` site configuration was removed in favour of each code-host's equivalent options, now configured via [external services](#Repositories-are-managed-by-configuring-external-services). Equivalent options in code hosts configuration:
  - Github via [`github.repos`](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/site_config/all#repos-array)
  - Gitlab via [`gitlab.projectQuery`](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/site_config/all#projectquery-array)
  - Phabricator via [`phabricator.repos`](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/site_config/all#phabricator-array)
  - [Other external services](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/repo/add_from_other_external_services)

## Some site configuration options have moved to a separate management console

TODO(stephen): describe what actions (if any) a user admin needs to take. Try to avoid duplicating info that is available elsewhere in docs/blog post (link to that information instead).

## PostgreSQL was upgraded from 9.6 to 11.1

TODO(Keegan, @tsenart): What actions does an admin need to take (if any). Are the versions above correct?
